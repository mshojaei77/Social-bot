# Social Media Bots

Welcome to my personal collection of social media bots! Here you'll find a variety of bots that can automate tasks and enhance your experience on platforms like Telegram and Discord.

Whether you're a community manager looking to streamline your workflow, or just someone who wants to add some extra functionality to your favorite social media platform, this repository has something for you. From chatbots and moderation tools to notification systems and data analysis scripts, there's a wide range of bots to choose from.

All of the bots in this repository are customizable and open source, so feel free to download them and modify them to suit your needs. And if you have any suggestions for new bots to add to the collection, don't hesitate to let me know! I'm always looking for new ways to improve and expand this repository.

Happy botting!
